Description:
The data source was published by Ryan Cummings on Kaggle.com and contains data about the mobility service Citi Bike from its launch until October 2013.
The data is published on trip level containing the date and time, the location of the start and end trip, and some general demographic data (if available) such as gender, and birth year. 
The total count of rows is 50,000. 

Motivation:
I’ve chosen this data source for analysis as I’ve been working in the mobility space in my previous career and am interested in mobility patterns, especially in the shared space.
